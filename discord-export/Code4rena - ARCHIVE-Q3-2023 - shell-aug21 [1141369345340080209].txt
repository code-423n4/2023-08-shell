What are the resources we have to read to get the context of in-scope contracts


[08/18/2023 14:18] viraz4331
All the details are mentioned in the audit repo which would be open sourced on mon

I'll try and share a doc with some details though meanwhile


[08/18/2023 15:56] viraz4331
the readme of the audit repo with all relevant info will be made public on mon

All tests are passing for me including the one you mentioned


[08/21/2023 21:17] Matt++#2677
I'll try on my virtual machine prob someting weird in my vscode. Is there a list of what I can and can't ask in these channels? I saw someone ask something specific to a bug and got a warning about potentially being banned so wanted to be careful

How are MAX_PRICE_VALUE and MIN_PRICE_VALUE derived and what is the intent in their use in bounding init and final prices?


[08/21/2023 22:56] mahdi9606
it seems EvolvingProteus only contains view functions and used for calculation of another contract which is not in scope


[08/22/2023 03:00] 0xaxe
Hey mates,I'm somewhat uncertain about the scope of the audit. Is the audit scope limited to just one contract for this contest? For example, is it limited to the "EvolvingProteus.sol" contract located at "src/proteus/EvolvingProteus.sol"?


[08/22/2023 03:11] viraz4331
That's based on the algorithm design and our testing results

The min and Max values are 10^8 and 10 ^ -8 we then convert it using abdk math


[08/22/2023 03:11] viraz4331
All info is mentioned in the readme code comments


[08/22/2023 03:12] viraz4331
Yes


[08/22/2023 03:12] viraz4331
It only does computation, the other contract which calls the evolving proteus contract has already been audited before


[08/22/2023 03:14] viraz4331
Are u still getting the issue ?


[08/22/2023 03:33] Matt++#2677
Yeah it‚Äôs just that one test that keeps failing for some reason


[08/22/2023 03:38] 0xaxe
Thanks mate ü´∂


[08/22/2023 03:40] viraz4331
Can you DM me the price values you're passing in


[08/22/2023 03:42] Matt++#2677
yeah lemme try one more thing, going to fresh install repo and dependancies then if that doesn't work I'll bug you further


[08/22/2023 03:43] viraz4331
also that test might be failing due to prices being near extreme point of the curve and would be out of scope as mentioned in readme just a background on a potential cause


[08/22/2023 03:43] viraz4331
Yeah thanks


[08/22/2023 04:54] tamayonft
I installed the dependencies with foundry and all test are passed

forge update didn't work I tried that first


[08/22/2023 05:06] Matt++#2677

Hi @Viraz @Ish @Kenny , can you explain why there is an initial / final min and max price? I'm trying to understand why the prices of the x and y tokens are decoupled instead of being the inverse of each other.


[08/22/2023 10:28] 0xlgtm
Also, how can I use the ABDK library to calculate the same value for MAX_PRICE_VALUE and MIN_PRICE_VALUE?


[08/22/2023 10:30] viraz4331
hey,
thanks so this is based on the algorithm being used more details here https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-shell/blob/main/README.md#how-does-the-algorithm-work

the `x_init` price in the code is the  the minimum price at the initial block
the `y_init` price in the code is the  the max price at the initial block
the `y_final` price in the code is the  the max price at the final block
the `x_final` price in the code is the  the min price at the initial block


[08/22/2023 10:31] viraz4331
@Kenny can you too provide your insights on this too


[08/22/2023 10:33] viraz4331
same like here
so 
```
MIN_PRICE_VALUE = ABDKMath64x64.divu(10^12, 1e18);
MAX_PRICE_VALUE = ABDKMath64x64.divu(10^26, 1e18);
```

[08/22/2023 11:14] grandfather042
can someone explain this?  // at all times x price should be less than y price
        if (py_init <= px_init) revert InvalidPrice();
        if (py_final <= px_final) revert InvalidPrice(); How can I add two stablecoin in this case?


[08/22/2023 11:26] viraz4331
please go through this https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-shell#key-terminology
we won't be using it for stable pools actually since for stable coins concentrated liquidity doesn't need to evolve over time

so we use static proteus which is already live for stable pools

At a high level, I understand how it works but I can't quite wrap my head around the 4 different prices.


[08/22/2023 12:04] viraz4331

@Kenny can you have a go too


[08/22/2023 12:05] viraz4331
This is the idea basically

[08/22/2023 12:09] 0xlgtm
Thank you!


[08/22/2023 12:26] viraz4331
I'll give another go

The 4 prices are the max and min prices for both assets at the start and at the end and then over time depending on how the prices are set the curve evolves accordingly


[08/22/2023 12:33] grandfather042
and the price is calculated for each block, right?


[08/22/2023 12:34] viraz4331
Yes it varies every block until the final block depending on the duration of the curve evolution is reached

[08/22/2023 13:44] viraz4331

All tests are fuzz tests only thing is we don't use the keyword fuzz in the function name

Each foundry test function which takes args is a fuzz test


[08/22/2023 13:51] castle_chain
ok , I need to understand the py and the px can be represent by a curve (relation ) between what ? time and price , or the two reserves of the two tokens ?? @Viraz


[08/22/2023 13:54] viraz4331
It's a representation of the bonding curve evolution over a period of time kinda like how dutch auction works but for amm's and ofc involving 2 assets

[08/22/2023 14:39] plamkata
@Viraz @Ish @Kenny I can't seem to understand the utility parameter


[08/22/2023 14:40] plamkata
In order to composite all the smaller functions into a single curve you use the utility multiplied by a kappa in order to connect the curves into 1 composite


[08/22/2023 14:40] plamkata
But what does utility on it's own without the kappa represent


[08/22/2023 15:05] viraz4331
It's the measure of the value of the liquidity in the pool for lp's to calculate yield for lp's


[08/22/2023 15:06] plamkata
To avoid using token reserves, you introduce a third measure?


[08/22/2023 15:07] castle_chain
@Viraz  why the price ratio calculated like this , why do not divide the py over px ?

I can imagine the equations but I just forgot and got lost searching for it


[08/22/2023 15:11] viraz4331

Is there any specific part of the contract - any function, logic, flow etc. that you think has the potential to cause issues and should get more attention?


[08/22/2023 18:03] viraz4331
not really the whole of evolving proteus contract is critical since it is responsible for the amm related computations


[08/22/2023 18:10] k736
Utility is basically the AMM‚Äôs invariant. Before and after every swap, utility should remain constant. It is basically how the pool measures value internally. 

a and b are parameters that determine the pools utility function. Another way to say this is that a and b determine the shape of the bonding curve. 

I should emphasize that utility can increase or decrease after a deposit or withdrawal. But the utility/LP token should never decrease. 

Lastly, while the AMM is evolving, the utility will change between blocks. The utility invariant refers to transactions within the same block.


[08/22/2023 18:11] plamkata
Yeah I was gonna ask what it is initially but it is just a and b


[08/22/2023 18:11] k736
A and b are parameters used to calculate utility


[08/22/2023 18:12] plamkata
Yeah and they are calculated based on the py and px

[08/22/2023 18:16] k736
Correct. The py and px parameters refer to the maximum price quoted by the AMM and the minimum price quoted. It‚Äôs a bit like the price range in Uniswap v3.

this isn't the whitepaper for evolving proteus just a  fyi 
and probably @Kenny would be the best person to answer ur second ques


[08/22/2023 19:00] k736
Identity curves are the smaller curves, closer to the origin. Their size does not change. We scale the identity curves to the size of the pool to get the ‚Äúregular‚Äù bonding curve.

my first question is related to the update 3 not the first white paper


[08/22/2023 19:02] castle_chain
how do the purple and the orange segments have the same utility and not the same scale vector ? @Kenny what about this ?


[08/22/2023 19:02] viraz4331
yeah update 3 too is about static proteus which is already live and not evolving proteus


[08/22/2023 19:03] k736
Utility is a measure of value in the pool and must be the same for every segment. The scale factor compares different segments to each other. The bigger the scale factor, the more ‚Äúexpanded‚Äù the segment is. 

I want to emphasize that understanding the scale factor is less important for the Evolving Proteus smart contract because the Evolving Proteus only has one segment, and hence the scale factor is always one (so we don‚Äôt include it in the code or the mathematical model)

Thanks! This is really helpful to understanding why there are 4 params.


[08/23/2023 01:05] 0xlgtm
From the simulation, I noticed that over time, the price on the y axis goes down and the price on the x axis goes right. Is it possible to reverse it? Or is it only intended to go 1 way?


[08/23/2023 01:08] 0xlgtm
~~Also the MAX_PRICE_VALUE and MIN_PRICE_VALUE are values on the y axis right? i.e. how much x  is worth in terms of y (numeraire token)~~
Yep, the README states
> Hence, prices refer to the value of token_x in terms of token_y.


[08/23/2023 01:15] k736
It can go either way. Both can increase. Both can decrease. One can increase and one can decrease.

hey wardens,
there is a small typo in comment here https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-shell/blob/c61cf0e01bada04c3d6055acb81f61955ed600aa/src/proteus/EvolvingProteus.sol#L459
the right comment is 
```
`We use FEE_DOWN because we want to decrease the perceived amount of
 reserve tokens leaving the pool and to decrease the observed amount of LP tokens being burned
```
thanks @lsaudit for pointing out


[08/23/2023 05:05] plamkata

Yeah but like, utility = how much LP


[08/23/2023 05:06] plamkata
Or utility IS the LP

[08/23/2023 10:35] Audinarey#1058
@Viraz please come clear on this as your current explanation means ```y_init``` and ```x_init``` are the same


[08/23/2023 10:37] Audinarey#1058
Also, @Viraz and @Kenny the documentation says
```
int128 p_min_current - the maximum price (at the y asymptote) at the current block
int128 p_max_current - the minimum price (at the x asymptote) at the current block
```
is this correct? or there is a typo error?


[08/23/2023 10:57] viraz4331
no they are not same as mentioned above
```
the x_init price in the code is the  the minimum price at the initial block
the y_init price in the code is the  the max price at the initial block
```
whereas 
```
int128 p_min_current - the maximum price (at the y asymptote) at the current block
int128 p_max_current - the minimum price (at the x asymptote) at the current block
```


[08/23/2023 10:57] viraz4331

hi @Viraz can you check DMs please


[08/23/2023 12:15] trachev
@Viraz How are p_min_init and p_max_init different from p_min_current and p_max_current, so that ``int128 p_max_init: the maximum price at the initial block
int128 p_min_init: the minimum price at the initial block``
and ``int128 p_min_current - the maximum price (at the y asymptote) at the current block
int128 p_max_current - the minimum price (at the x asymptote) at the current block``?


[08/23/2023 12:21] viraz4331
init vars are basically values at the starting block time and current ones are the values computed in a any block b/w the init and the final block so it's real time/instantaneous


[08/23/2023 12:22] trachev
Yes, but why are the current ones inverted, the min_current is the maximum price and max_current is the minimum price?


[08/23/2023 12:24] 0xlgtm
@Kenny sent you a friend request, have a question re. utility.


[08/23/2023 12:37] viraz4331

Hey wardens,

the min_current is the min price and max_current is the max price


[08/23/2023 12:43] hisoul22
Are you referring to the following part?


[08/23/2023 12:43] hisoul22
int128 p_min_current - the maximum price (at the y asymptote) at the current block
int128 p_max_current - the minimum price (at the x asymptote) at the current block

In the case of evolving proteus, the value of `k` is always `1`. We use `k` in static Proteus (the white paper is linked in the readme). In the case of static proteus, we have multiple slices. We need the `k` term to compare utility between slices. However, in evolving proteus, we only ever have one slice and hence do not need to include `k` in the math operations of the smart contract. Arguably, we should remove `k` from the comments in the .sol contract since it is no longer relevant.

the MAX_M and MIN_M is there to control the ratio between token x and token y. For MAX_M, it says at most 10^8 y for each x whereas for MIN_M it says at most 10^8 **x for each y** (it's flipped) i.e. at most 1/10^8 y for each x.


[08/25/2023 01:41] 0xlgtm
A numerical example would be a pool having 1 x and 10^8 y. This would hit the MAX_M limit. A pool with 10^8 x and 1 y will hit the MIN_M limit.


[08/25/2023 04:46] viraz4331
the quantity


[08/25/2023 04:53] 0xprinc
lp supply means the number of y tokens?


[08/25/2023 04:54] viraz4331
The values are in 64x64 form hence it is this way

use "yarn install" or "yarn i" to install the nodemodules path (install yarn or npm if you don't have), and be sure to install forge


[08/25/2023 11:55] superman_i4g
Yarn not recognized


[08/25/2023 11:56] fulum
install yarn, you have multiple tutorial on the web


[08/25/2023 11:57] fulum
I think you can use classical "npm" if you have it


[08/25/2023 11:57] superman_i4g

Hey wardens,
There have been a lot of queries around how the fee mechanism works here is a detailed explanation by @Ish


[08/25/2023 13:49] viraz4331 (pinned)
The fee is applied twice in every swap/deposit/withdraw, first it is applied to the amount that the user specifies and then at the end to the resulting amount of the operation. The fee is applied by either increasing or decreasing the amount, depending on the situation. 

When the specified amount is a value that the user is giving up (swapGivenInputAmount, depositGivenInputAmount, or withdrawGivenInputAmount), the fee is applied down. This means that we are basically telling the pool that the specified inputAmount is LESS than what the user actually specified, and we also take a fee on the resulting output amount that the user receives. 

Example: User wants to swap 1 X for Y, apply first fee to make it 0.99X, compute Y output (let's say its 0.99Y), then apply second fee to make it 0.98Y

The opposite occurs when the specified value is what the user wants to receive (swapGivenOutputAmount, depositGivenOutputAmount, withdrawGivenOutputAmount).

Example: User wants to swap X for 1 Y, apply first fee to make it 1.01Y, compute X input (let's say its 1.01X), then apply second fee to make it 1.02X

 There are two components to the fee, `BASE_FEE` and `FIXED_FEE`. `BASE_FEE` is the basis point percentage that the amounts are increased/decreased by, and `FIXED_FEE` is a static number that is added/subtracted in order to alleviate precision issues

[08/26/2023 07:56] viraz4331 (pinned)
hey wardens,
there has been some confusion around the `BASE_FEE = 800`  in the comment it is mentioned as roughly 25 bps which is correct 

In the fee rounding method
base_fee is applied as `absolute_amount / base_fee`  and it is applied twice so it is almost 25 bps and the final fee amount depends on the absolute_amount


[08/26/2023 08:06] superman_i4g
Installed yarn and now getting some kinda compiler error. I think I will have to try import the file again and run forge build


[08/26/2023 09:12] debofx
Also have a look on github for download of node_modules folder which has openzeppelin etc.


[08/26/2023 09:21] superman_i4g
Yea, might just prefer using Remix since it‚Äôs compiling on there.


[08/26/2023 10:06] dev0cloo
I had the same error. Fixed it by running `npm install` and then running `forge build` and it compiled successfully. Hope that helps!


[08/26/2023 10:45] superman_i4g
Tried it already, not working. It‚Äôs compiling on Remix so I am just gonna go with it.


[08/26/2023 13:18] itsmetechjay
Pinned a message.


[08/26/2023 16:42] debofx
Ok. In VS Code, I always have a routine to configure remappings.txt and yarn add openzeppelin, etc and git clone forge-std, DS-Test for foundry.


[08/26/2023 16:54] superman_i4g
I have one too. Just that this time around remappings.text was not included only yarn


[08/26/2023 16:56] debofx
Also, I just heard about a new website or tool called auditwizard io which is also good, but could not compile the inscope contract on there. You can use slither on there for most of the competitions though.


[08/26/2023 16:57] superman_i4g
Yes, audit wizard is good. Just needs more improvement. Although that‚Äôs just the beta. Perhaps the full version will be more polished

Does the liquidity pool take all kinds of tokens?


[08/27/2023 03:18] viraz4331
All tokens including  nfts are first wrapped into erc1155 tokens  by the ocean after that all tokens are 18 decimals and the evolving proteus does computation for those tokens

Try and search (ctrl + f) the file for vulnerabilities. Because scans sometimes do not pick them up.

I hardly relay on scans
